The Network News Transfer Protocol or NNTP is an Internet application protocol for the distribution of news and occasionally binary files.

[Usenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), represents the most common usage of the NNTP protocol.

The Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) interface allows user application code to create its own filesystems and publish them using kernel support. FUSE is primarily available in Unix-like systems.

This software will allow (when completed) read-only mounting of news-servers through FUSE.

CURRENT STATUS: usable alpha

BIGGEST ISSUE: no management for cached information

Added mplayerfs, a file system that plays all media files that are written to it.
